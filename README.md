*Connect with the Polygon Mumbai Testnet!!*

This is an NFT marketplace where you can upload an image, set a description, and set a name for the NFT. It uses solidity to write the transactions and connects with Metamask to make the transactions. After uploading, you can buy any NFTs.

*When uploading an NFT, wait a bit after the first transaction and a second transaction will automatically pop up; this is the listing transaction.*
